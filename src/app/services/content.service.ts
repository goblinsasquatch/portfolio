The script compares 6 input files, produces an Excel document of the results - highlighting any discrepancies - builds 3 Word document reports, and produces 2 template pdfs for the aircraft log book. All the user has to do is input the aircraft tail number, and the script pulls in the required default data. This allowed me the time to do JCS modules 4 and 5 ðŸ˜€ ",

It includes a signal conditioning circuit, feeding 4 Arduino Micros, that communicate with a Raspberry Pi over I2C, that then uses HDMI for display on a projector.
